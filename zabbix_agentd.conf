##### Passive checks related

### Option: Server
#	List of comma delimited IP addresses (or hostnames) of Zabbix servers.
#	Incoming connections will be accepted only from the hosts listed here.
#	If IPv6 support is enabled then '127.0.0.1', '::127.0.0.1', '::ffff:127.0.0.1' are treated equally.

#
ListenIP=0.0.0.0

### Option: StartAgents
#	Number of pre-forked instances of zabbix_agentd that process passive checks.
#	If set to 0, disables passive checks and the agent will not listen on any TCP port.
#

##### Active checks related

### Option: ServerActive
#	List of comma delimited IP:port (or hostname:port) pairs of Zabbix servers for active checks.
#	If port is not specified, default port is used.
#	IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in square brackets if port for that host is specified.
#	If port is not specified, square brackets for IPv6 addresses are optional.
#	If this parameter is not specified, active checks are disabled.
#	Example: ServerActive=127.0.0.1:20051,zabbix.domain,[::1]:30051,::1,[12fc::1]
#
ServerActive=

### Option: Hostname
#	Unique, case sensitive hostname.
#	Required for active checks and must match hostname as configured on the server.
#	Value is acquired from HostnameItem if undefined.

#	Does not support UserParameters or aliases.
#


### Option: HostMetadata
#	Optional parameter that defines host metadata.
#	Host metadata is used at host auto-registration process.
#	An agent will issue an error and not start if the value is over limit of 255 characters.
#	If not defined, value will be acquired from HostMetadataItem.
#
HostMetadata=

### Option: HostMetadataItem

#	provided in 'log' or 'logrt' item keys.
#
MaxLinesPerSecond=100

############ ADVANCED PARAMETERS #################

### Option: Alias
#	Sets an alias for an item key. It can be used to substitute long and complex item key with a smaller and simpler one.
#	Multiple Alias parameters may be present. Multiple parameters with the same Alias key are not allowed.
#	Different Alias keys may reference the same item key.
#	For example, to retrieve the ID of user 'zabbix':
#	Alias=zabbix.userid:vfs.file.regexp[/etc/passwd,^zabbix:.:([0-9]+),,,,\1]
#	Now shorthand key zabbix.userid may be used to retrieve data.
#	Aliases can be used in HostMetadataItem but not in HostnameItem parameters.
#
